<p>To add a light in the IDE entity editor, click on the add entity button in the top left corner of the editor screen. After creating the light, you can edit its settings in the entity properties to the right.</p>
<h4 id="creating">Creating lights in code.</h4>
<p>You can create lights dynamically in code via the SceneLight class.</p>
<p>Polycode's lights get automatically sorted by the renderer and passed to materials based on distance to the rendered entity and the light's importance setting. Material shaders can define how many lights of each type they accept.</p>
<p>There are currently two types of lights you can create.</p>
<p><b>SceneLight::POINT_LIGHT</b> - A positional light that shines in all directions.</p>
<p><b>SceneLight::SPOT_LIGHT</b> - A positional, directional spot light that shines light in a cone. Can cast shadows.</p>
<p>To create a light, instantiate a SceneLight class and use Scene's <b>addLight</b> to add it to the scene. This adds it as a light to the scene, but it doesn't add it to the root entity as a child, so you can add it as a child to another entity if you need to attach the light to something else.</p>
