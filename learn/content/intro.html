        <p class="lead">Welcome to the Polycode learning section! This collection of articles will take you from setting up your first Polycode application all the way through most of its main features.</p>
	<p>The articles are organized roughly in the order they should be read, but feel free to jump to any of the sections and read about a specific feature.</p>
	<p>The articles contain example code in both C++ and Lua, except for features where Lua bindings are not supported.</p>
	<p>The articles are under continuous development and may contain errors. If you would like to contribute an article or see an error that should be fixed, please fork the <a href="https://github.com/ivansafrin/PolycodeSite">Polycode website on github</a> and submit a pull request.</p>
